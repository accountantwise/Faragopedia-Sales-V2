## Immutable Files

NEVER modify these files under any circumstances:
- `sources/` — all files and subdirectories
- `company_profile.md`
- `SCHEMA_TEMPLATE.md`

---

## Page Schemas

All wiki pages use YAML frontmatter for Obsidian Dataview compatibility. Use wikilink syntax (`[[page-name]]`) for all cross-references.

## Operations

### Ingest
**Trigger:** User says "ingest [source]" or "ingest [filename]"

1. Read the source file from `sources/`
2. Discuss key takeaways with the user
3. Create or update all touched entity pages — file them into the correct subdirectory based on entity type
4. Update `index.md` — add any new pages, update summaries of changed pages
5. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | [source title]` followed by a 2–3 line summary of what was updated

A single source may touch 5–15 wiki pages. Update all of them.

---

### Query
**Trigger:** Any question about clients, prospects, contacts, photographers, productions, or relationships

1. Read `index.md` to identify the most relevant pages
2. Read those pages in full
3. Synthesize a clear answer with inline wikilink citations (`[[page-name]]`)
4. If the answer is valuable enough to keep (a comparison, analysis, or synthesis), offer to file it as a new wiki page
5. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | [topic]`

---

### Lint
**Trigger:** User says "lint"

1. Read all pages listed in `index.md`
2. Scan for orphan pages (pages with no inbound wikilinks from other pages)
3. Flag contradictions between pages (e.g. conflicting dates, roles, or status)
4. Identify entities mentioned in page text that lack their own page
5. Suggest data gaps that could be filled with a web search or new source
6. Flag pages whose frontmatter does not match the schema defined in their folder's `_type.yaml`
7. Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | [brief summary of findings]`

---

## General Rules

1. **Never modify** `sources/`, `company_profile.md`, or `SCHEMA_TEMPLATE.md`
2. **Always use wikilinks** — cite cross-references as `[[page-name]]` not plain text
3. **Prefer updating over creating** — update an existing page before creating a new one
4. **Keep index.md current** — update it on every ingest operation
5. **Keep log.md current** — append an entry on every ingest, query, and lint operation
6. **Sources inline** — cite sources in the relevant section of entity/production pages; no separate source summary pages
7. **Frontmatter always** — every wiki page must have valid YAML frontmatter matching its folder's `_type.yaml` schema
8. **File naming** — lowercase, hyphen-separated: `louis-vuitton.md`, `jamie-hawkesworth.md`, `2026-02-louis-vuitton-editorial.md`
9. **Respect folder types** — when creating or updating pages, use the frontmatter fields defined in that folder's `_type.yaml`
